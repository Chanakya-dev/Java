# Stepwise Java Thread Learning Path

## **Step 1: Thread Basics & Creation**

* Create threads by:
  * Extending `Thread` class
  * Implementing `Runnable` interface
  * Using Anonymous inner classes
  * Using Lambdas (Java 8+)
* Understand thread life cycle states: New, Runnable, Running, Waiting, Timed Waiting, Blocked, Terminated
* Start threads with `start()`
* Difference between `run()` and `start()`

## **Step 2: Thread Scheduling and Priorities**

* Set and get thread priorities with `setPriority()` and `getPriority()`
* Understand how thread scheduling works (OS dependent)
* Learn about daemon threads (`setDaemon(true)`)

## **Step 3: Thread Synchronization Basics**

* Use `synchronized` methods and blocks to protect shared resources
* Understand intrinsic locks (monitor locks)
* Learn static synchronized methods

## **Step 4: Thread Communication**

* Understand `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()` for inter-thread communication
* Learn how to use them inside synchronized blocks

## **Step 5: Thread Interruption**

* Interrupt threads with `interrupt()`
* Handle `InterruptedException`
* Check thread interruption status with `isInterrupted()` and `interrupted()`

## **Step 6: Volatile Variables**

* Learn the `volatile` keyword and how it ensures visibility across threads
* Understand when to use volatile vs synchronized

## **Step 7: ThreadLocal Variables**

* Learn to use `ThreadLocal` for thread-confined variables
* Understand lifecycle and use cases

## **Step 8: Higher-level Concurrency Utilities**

* Learn Executors framework:

  * `Executor`, `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService`
  * Use thread pools like `FixedThreadPool`, `CachedThreadPool`
* Use `Callable` and `Future` for tasks that return results

## **Step 9: Locks and Conditions**

* Use explicit locks (`ReentrantLock`) and their advantages over synchronized
* Use `Condition` objects for advanced thread communication (`await()`, `signal()`, `signalAll()`)

## **Step 10: Atomic Variables and Classes**

* Learn atomic classes (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`, etc.)
* Use atomic operations for lock-free thread safety

## **Step 11: Thread Safety and Concurrent Collections**

* Understand thread-safe programming principles
* Use thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `BlockingQueue`

## **Step 12: Advanced Synchronizers**

* Learn synchronization utilities like:

  * `CountDownLatch`
  * `CyclicBarrier`
  * `Semaphore`
  * `Exchanger`
  * `Phaser`

## **Step 13: Deadlocks and Race Conditions**

* Understand what causes deadlocks and how to avoid them
* Detect and prevent race conditions
* Learn best practices to write deadlock-free and race-free code

## **Step 14: Java Memory Model**

* Learn basics of the Java Memory Model (JMM)
* Understand happens-before relationships and visibility guarantees

## **Step 15: Debugging and Performance**

* Learn to analyze thread dumps
* Best practices to optimize thread performance
* Use thread naming and grouping (`ThreadGroup`)
